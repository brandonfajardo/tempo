# Tempo

Used a redux boiler plate (https://github.com/StephenGrider/ReduxSimpleStarter),

I decided to create a lookup for both loaded users and teams which increased the performance of the application. State was handled by Redux.

### Setup

1. Clone/Download
2. cd into folder
3. npm install
4. npm start (localhost:8080)
